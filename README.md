## Installation
To set up the project locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/yourproject.git
    ```
2. **Navigate to the project directory:**
    ```bash
    cd yourproject
    ```
3. **Install dependencies:**
    - For SSH server configuration:
      ```bash
      sudo apt-get install openssh-server
      ```
    - For MySQL setup:
      ```bash
      sudo apt-get install mysql-server
      ```
4. **Start SSH server:**
    ```bash
    sudo systemctl start ssh
    ```
5. **Configure MySQL:**
    - Secure installation:
      ```bash
      sudo mysql_secure_installation
      ```
    - Create a new database:
      ```sql
      CREATE DATABASE your_database;
      ```

## Usage
- **SSH Server:** Use the following command to connect to the server:
    ```bash
    ssh username@server_ip_address
    ```
- **MySQL Database:** Connect to the MySQL database:
    ```bash
    mysql -u root -p your_database
    ```
- **Basic SQL Commands:**
    - Create a table:
      ```sql
      CREATE TABLE example_table (id INT PRIMARY KEY, name VARCHAR(50));
      ```
    - Insert data:
      ```sql
      INSERT INTO example_table (id, name) VALUES (1, 'Example Name');
      ```
    - Update data:
      ```sql
      UPDATE example_table SET name = 'New Name' WHERE id = 1;
      ```
    - Delete data:
      ```sql
      DELETE FROM example_table WHERE id = 1;
      ```
